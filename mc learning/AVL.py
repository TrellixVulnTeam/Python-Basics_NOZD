What is Gini index in decision tree?
Gini Index For Decision Trees.The hierarchical structure of a decision 
tree leads us to the final outcome by traversing through the nodes of 
the tree. Each node consists of an attribute or feature which is 
further split into more nodes as we move down the tree.
