Types Of Learning Techniques:
a) Supervise Learning
b) Unsupervise Learning
c) Reinforcement Learning
'''

'''
a) Supervise Learning is a technique when system have a knowledge feature as well as information regarding that
product or feature.In technical term feature and label.

b)Unsupervise Learning requires trainer in this
Its a technique where only product classification(feature) is there which are 
informed/defined to machine not product name(label).

c) Reward based training is called Reinforcement Learning.Its a part of Deep Learning.
Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. 
It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular 
situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the 
best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation.

Data are of 2 types:
a) Classification Data is a type of data where data into distinct classes.
This model is built by inputting a set of training data for which the classes 
are pre-labeled in order for the algorithm to learn from.
and
b) Regression Data is a continuous data
